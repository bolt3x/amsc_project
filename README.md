## Project for AMSC 22/23: Implementation of FFT algorithm

### After cloning the directory you can use the 'make' command to build the executable, it will be found in the build directory.
## To run the file ./fft use the flags:

```
-r Recursive FFT
```

```
-t Iterative FFT (Cooley-Tukey Algorithm)
```

```
-p Parallel FFT with MPI
```

```
-i Inverse FFT
```

### The Input signal at the moment is fixed....
